                <p>Rice is an annual plant that is harvested once a year. The cultivation of rice is suited for countries with low labor costs and high rainfall as it is very labor intensive and requires 
                large amounts of water for cultivation. Small rice seedlings are hand planted into rice paddies that are then filled with water. 
                The seeds draw nutrients from the paddies water, which is also the same water…

                <p>Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food.[1][2][3] The many species of wheat together make up the genus Triticum;
                the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum).
                The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. 
                Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis

                <p>Maize, scientific name Zea mays, also known as corn or mielie/mealie, is one of the most extensively cultivated cereal crops on Earth. 
                More maize is produced, by weight, than any other grain, and almost every country on Earth cultivates maize commercially for a variety of uses. The abundant cultivation of maize globally has led to concerns about 
                monocropping and biodiversity.

            <p>Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus Saccharum, tribe 
            Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar
            production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the
            stalk internodes. </p>

            <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves 
             of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub (bush) native to Asia.[3] After water, it is the most widely consumed 
            drink in the world.[4] There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, 
            have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent.

The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of 
             the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. </p>
